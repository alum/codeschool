Hi,
my name is Filip Bonnevier.
I'm a software engineer and technology guy who likes to help.

There is a huge number of refugees coming to Sweden right now,
mainly from Syria.
I want to help them.
Here we have a really high demand for programmers.

I'm thinking, if I can help just one person getting some knowledge about programming,
then that could potentially lead to a job for that person some day.
That is my hope with this project.

/Filip
